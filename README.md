# Welcome to the code!

This repository is home to the code for my website "shreyas.site", which I am building to showcase all things design in my life. 

The code is very basic right now as you can see in 'docs/index.html'. As and when I start building elements into it, they will be pointed out on this README.md file.

Elements of 'shreyas.site'
