# Welcome to the code!

This repository is home to the code for my website "shreyas.site", which I am building to showcase all things design in my life. 

The code is very basic right now as you can see in 'docs/index.html'. As and when I start building elements into it, they will be pointed out on this 'README.md' file. Please keep in mind, I don't explain the code - but only (what I believe are) the design elements.

Elements of 'shreyas.site'
--------------------------

1. Main Title

![Title](/images/main-title.png?raw=true "Introductory Title For The Page") 

A one-line entry to what this website is: its says its me, but its rather just me introducing myself and trying to connect with the viewers: the users.

2. Brief Description

![Title](/images/brief-description.png?raw=true "Brief Description")

This part of the site is a brief introduction to who I am, only to include what matters to the site: the design part & building the website part.

3. End Notes

![Title](/images/end-notes.png?raw=true "End Notes")

This might be what brought you here, and also to enable users to contact me if they wish to connect. The element that allows for further understanding about me, and about the website they're visiting.


As I said at the top, currently this is very basic & might be true if you say I'm not explaining the elements right. They are rather just 'components' right now. And, each component here serves a purpose - hopefully enough to understand that the website is built by a newbie who's learning to design.
